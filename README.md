# Chess_Project
This SQL code is designed to analyze a dataset of chess games. The dataset is stored in a database named "chess" and the code includes several queries to extract insights and statistics about the games.

The first query calculates the average number of moves to win a game for games where the victory status was either "mate" or "resign".

The second query compares the win rates for players playing as either white or black. The query calculates the percentage of games won by each color.

The third query identifies the 10 best opening moves with the highest win rates. The query groups games by the name of the opening move and calculates the win rate for each opening move.

The fourth query calculates the number of games played by each player that resulted in a victory for the black player. The results are grouped by the number of moves it took for the game to end and are ordered by the number of losses in descending order.

The fifth query identifies the best player in the dataset. The query groups games by the ID of the player and the color of the player who won the game. The query then orders the results by the number of wins in descending order and returns only the top result.

The sixth query groups games by the length of the game in turns and calculates the number of games that fall into each length range.

The seventh and final query identifies the most common opening moves for each player color. The query groups games by the color of the winning player and the name and ply of the opening move. The results are ordered by the number of games in descending order and are limited to the top 10 results.

Overall, these queries provide insights into various aspects of chess gameplay, including the effectiveness of certain opening moves, the distribution of game lengths, and the performance of players based on the color they are playing.
